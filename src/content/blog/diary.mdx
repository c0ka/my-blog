From shopping to investing to banking, the global economy is steadily evolving towards a digital ecosystem.
Back in 2019 Facebook decided to launch their own entry in the booming digital currency revolution with the introduction of Libra.
As the project evolved, however, Libra became more than just a digital currency. Now rebranded as Diem,
the Facebook-led global payment system is expected to launch in mid-February 2021.

Facebook needed to build an information onramp for Diem.
Not just a front door to the brand, but also a gateway to member and developer portals.
They turned to Boulder, Colorado-based Dfuzr Industries to create Diem.com â€”
and Dfuzr turned to Gatsby.
